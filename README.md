## HackBio Cancer Internship Repository
# Description
This repository includes a series of projects and analyses conducted during the HackBio Cancer Internship. The projects explore various aspects of cancer biology, including antibiotic resistance, genomic analyses, differential gene expression, and biomarker discovery, with a focus on different types of cancers such as glioblastoma, ovarian carcinoma, and acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
