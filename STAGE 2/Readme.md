# Gene Expression Analysis in Glioblastoma
## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing gene expression raw data to predict differentially expressed genes of significance and perform functional enrichment analysis in glioblastoma samples. The study aims to identify molecular subtypes and gene signatures that can aid in biomarker discovery and targeted therapy for glioblastoma patients.

## Results
Heatmap Analysis: Revealed two distinct groups of glioblastoma samples (S1-S5 and S6-S10).
Differentially Expressed Genes: Identified 10 overexpressed and 2 underexpressed genes between groups.
Functional Enrichment: The differentially expressed genes were involved in biological pathways such as proteolysis and glutathione metabolism.
