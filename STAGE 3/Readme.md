# Project Overview
This project aims to identify potential biomarkers for Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) recurrence through differential gene expression (DGE) analysis and machine learning (ML). The dataset used was sourced from TARGET-AML in TCGA.

# Key Findings
Differential Gene Expression: Identified 24 differentially expressed genes between primary and recurrent AML samples.
Functional Enrichment: Top pathways included leukocyte migration, endocrine system development, and regulation of cytokine production.
ML Model Performance: Achieved 100% training accuracy and 91% testing accuracy, identifying key features relevant to AML recurrence.
