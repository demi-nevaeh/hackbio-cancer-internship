## Repository Description
This repository presents a comprehensive review of the study "Integrated Genomic Analyses of Ovarian Carcinoma" conducted by the Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network. The study provides significant insights into the molecular characteristics of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGS-OvCa), which accounts for the majority of deaths from ovarian cancer due to its aggressiveness and poor prognosis. The research aims to identify molecular abnormalities that affect disease development, patient outcomes, and potential therapeutic targets.
