# Introduction
This project focuses on identifying potential biomarkers for low-grade glioblastoma (LGG) by leveraging differential gene expression (DGE) and unsupervised machine learning methods. Gliomas are the most common form of adult brain tumors, and recent classifications rely heavily on IDH mutation status due to its prognostic value. The goal is to uncover significant gene expressions and explore the relationships between different mutation statuses using clustering techniques.

## Key Findings
34 Differentially Expressed Genes: Key genes potentially involved in LGG progression.
Top Biological Pathways: Linked to embryonic development and morphogenesis, suggesting further exploration into their roles in glioblastoma.
Clustering Analysis: Identified distinct mutation-related groups, consistent with existing literature.
